# Reactube

This project was initially done as last assignment of the Front End path of the IT Academy Bootcamp.
The goal was to build a simple clone of YouTube, allowing the user to favorite videos and to keep a record of the last videos that were displayed.

## Status

Undergoing maintenance. Updates coming soon ƪ(ړײ)ƪ​​

## Navigate through branches

### main

In main branch goes the latest stable version of the app.

### development

In development branch there is the app "work in progress", with the latest working features successfully merged.

### dev/ branches

All branches whose names start with "dev/" are working branches each for its own major feature.

### ex/ branches

The assignment had 3 levels of increasing difficulty; these are reflected in the 3 branches whose names start with "ex/".
Level 2 and 3 were optional, but I had some fun implementing them.

## Create React App Info

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
