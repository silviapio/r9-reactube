> This project was my first challenging project with React.js.
> It was submitted as last assignment of the Front End path of the IT Academy Bootcamp; there were 3 different levels of increasing difficulty, you can see them reflected in branches.
> The goal was to build a clone of YouTube, allowing the user to favorite their videos and to keep a record of the last videos that were displayed.

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

```sh
npm start
```

## Navigate through branches

There are many branches in this project, forgive me, it was my first complex solo project ƪ(ړײ)ƪ​​

- `main`

In main branch goes the latest stable version of the app.

- `development`

In development branch there is the app "work in progress", with the latest working features successfully merged.

- `dev/` branches

All branches whose names start with `dev/` are working branches each for its own feature.

- `ex/` branches

The assignment had 3 levels of increasing difficulty; these are reflected in the 3 branches whose names start with `ex/`. Level 2 and 3 were optional, but I had some fun implementing them (of course, why not choosing the most challenging path 😉)
